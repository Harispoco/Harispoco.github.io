        <h3>Project Overview</h3>
        <p>
          In an era where data is the backbone of decision-making, the ability to translate raw transactional records into actionable business intelligence is crucial. This portfolio showcases a comprehensive end-to-end data analysis project focused on the 2019 Supermarket Sales Performance. The journey of this project begins with a deep dive into the technical foundation—the Data Integrity & Engineering phase. By utilizing a dataset consisting of 1,000 unique transactions across three regional branches (Yangon, Naypyitaw, and Mandalay), I performed rigorous data cleaning and structuring to ensure the reliability of every metric. This process involved standardizing financial variables, extracting time-based attributes for trend analysis, and organizing the data architecture within Excel to support dynamic reporting.
          Following the data preparation, the project transitions into the Strategic Visualization phase. Here, I synthesized complex variables—ranging from customer demographics and payment preferences to product line performance—into an intuitive, interactive dashboard. This report does not merely present numbers; it identifies critical market trends, such as the significant Q1 performance peak and the balanced penetration of our loyalty programs. 
          By bridging the gap between raw Excel data and high-level executive summaries, this analysis serves as a roadmap for identifying operational strengths and uncovering opportunities for sustainable retail growth.

        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>The following analysis provides a comprehensive overview of the 2019 sales performance for our supermarket operations across three key regions: Mandalay, Naypyitaw, and Yangon. This report is designed to evaluate core business health by examining key performance indicators (KPIs), such as total revenue and transaction volume, while also identifying critical trends in consumer behavior and geographical performance. 
          By dissecting the data across product categories, payment preferences, and customer demographics, this analysis aims to highlight both the operational successes of the past year and the strategic challenges that require attention to ensure sustainable growth in the future.

        <p>The technical foundation of this project is built upon a meticulously cleaned and structured dataset, which serves as the single source of truth for the supermarket sales dashboard. By transforming the raw data into an official Excel table format, the dataset ensures dynamic scalability and consistent data types across key variables such as Invoice ID, Branch, and Product line.
          Key data engineering steps were performed, including the extraction of the month attribute from transaction dates to enable time-series analysis and the standardization of financial metrics like Tax 5% and Total revenue. 
          This organized approach—evidenced by the separation of raw data, pivot tables, and final visualizations into dedicated worksheets—guarantees that the insights presented in the report are accurate, verifiable, and ready for professional business application.

<p>The Supermarket Sales Report for 2019 provides a detailed snapshot of a retail business operating across three cities: Mandalay, Naypyitaw, and Yangon. 
  According to the high-level metrics, the supermarket generated a Total Revenue of $322,966.75 from exactly 1,000 orders, resulting in an Average Revenue of $322.97 per transaction. 
  While the year started with a high volume of sales in the first quarter peaking in January at over $80,000 the "Sales Performance" chart reveals a steady downward trend, with monthly revenue stabilizing at significantly lower levels from April through December.

        <h3>Regional and Operational Insights</h3>

         <div class="text-center my-4">

       class="img-fluid rounded shadow" 
       style="max-width: 85%;"

       </div>

        <p>Geographically, Naypyitaw (Branch C) emerged as the leading location with a total of $110,568.71 in sales, followed closely by Mandalay and Yangon. 
          The product analysis shows distinct regional strengths: Naypyitaw dominates the Food and Beverages sector, while Yangon leads in Home and Lifestyle products. Operationally, customers show a nearly equal preference for E-wallets (345 transactions) and Cash (344 transactions), while credit cards are utilized slightly less frequently (311 transactions).

        <h3>Customer Demographics</h3>

       alt="Tabel Of Sales">
       </div>

        <p>From a demographic perspective, the supermarket maintains an exceptionally balanced reach. 
          The customer base is split perfectly 50/50 between Members and Normal shoppers, indicating successful loyalty program penetration. Additionally, the gender distribution is nearly even, with Females making up 51.98% of the clientele and Males accounting for 48.02%. This suggests that the supermarket's current product offerings and marketing strategies appeal broadly to a highly diverse audience.

        <h3>Conclusion & Strategic Summary</h3>
        <p>The 2019 Supermarket Sales Analysis reveals a business with a strong operational foundation but facing a significant growth challenge. While the year began with exceptional momentum, the sharp decline in revenue following the first quarter suggests a shift in market dynamics or consumer retention that requires immediate strategic attention.
          </p>
          <p>Operationally, the business maintains high efficiency, evidenced by an equal distribution of member versus normal customers and a nearly identical preference for Cash and E-wallet payments. 
          Geographically, Naypyitaw (Branch C) stands as the primary revenue driver, contributing the highest total sales of $110,568.71, while Yangon and Mandalay maintain stable and competitive performance. 
          Furthermore, the supermarket has successfully captured a diverse audience, maintaining a near-perfect gender balance and high loyalty program penetration. To reverse the downward sales trend observed after March, the business should focus on implementing seasonal marketing strategies to replicate the high-performance levels seen in January. 
          Leveraging Naypyitaw’s success in Food and Beverages and Yangon’s lead in Home and Lifestyle could serve as a blueprint to cross-promote underperforming categories in other branches. Additionally, introducing targeted rewards for credit card users could help balance payment methods and potentially increase the average transaction value.
          </p> 
          <p>In summary, by maintaining its demographic appeal while addressing the mid-year sales slump through data-driven marketing, the supermarket is well-positioned to stabilize its revenue and achieve sustainable year-over-year growth.
